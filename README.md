## Content


`models:` Files used by 3D printers to produce the vehicle elements.   
`schemes:` PDF schematic diagram illustrating all the electronic components used in the vehicle and their connections.  
`src:` Code of control software for all components programmed to participate in the competition.  
`t-photos:` 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members).  
`v-photos:` 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, top and bottom).  
`video:` Video.md file with the link to a n second long driving demonstration.

# Solution

## Mechanism
For our prototype's motor, we used a DC motor gear system, where the motor is connected to a differential wrist mechanism that moves the back wheels. Our front wheels do not get any direct power from the motor, instead being hooked to the servo to proportionally steer the vehicle.
