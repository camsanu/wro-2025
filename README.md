Engineering materials
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2025.

## Content


* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers to produce the vehicle elements.
* `schemes` contains a schematic diagram in form of PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the electronic components and motors used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition.
* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members).
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, top and bottom).
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a n second long driving demonstration.


## Introduction

_This part must be filled by participants with the technical clarifications about the code: which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicle’s controllers._
