## Content


`models:` files used by 3D printers to produce the vehicle's chassis.   
`schemes:` PDF schematic diagram illustrating the vehicle's circuitry.  
`src:` code of control software for all components programmed to participate.  
`t-photos:` 2 photos of the team (an official one and a funny photo).  
`v-photos:` 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, top and bottom).  
`video:` video.md file with the link to a n second long driving demonstration.

# Solution

## Mechanism
For our prototype's motor, we used a DC motor gear system, where the motor is connected to a differential wrist mechanism that drives the back wheels and provides consistent, even movement. The front wheels do not receive any direct power from the motor, instead both the front wheels are hooked to the servo by a simple mechanism that we designed and 3d printed, with this we can proportionally steer the vehicle by turning both wheels at the same direction, at the same time.
